<p>Hi, I'm Sherwin Vishesh Jathanna, a computer science undergraduate at Arizona State University, and I've been passionate about programming since the second grade. My journey with coding began early, and it has always been driven by a desire to apply technology to solve real-world problems. My latest initiative, the Atharv project, reflects my commitment to using innovative solutions to support the agricultural sector in India.</p>

<p>I developed Atharv as a summer project to directly address the challenges faced by Indian farmers, such as unreliable weather forecasts and inaccurate disease diagnostics. The project uses advanced artificial intelligence to deliver precise, real-time insights essential for effective farm management. By incorporating sophisticated weather prediction models and disease detection capabilities, Atharv empowers farmers to make informed decisions that improve crop yield and ensure sustainable farming practices.</p>

<p>Recognizing the importance of firsthand experience, I have conducted extensive field surveys in Karnataka to gather authentic data and understand the farmers' needs. This grassroots approach has not only provided invaluable insights for enhancing Atharv but also opened avenues for potential collaborations with governmental bodies. Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss how Atharv could be integrated with local agricultural programs with the district commissioner of Bengaluru Urban, aiming to expand its impact to benefit a broader farming community.</p>

<p>Driven by a vision to transform Indian agriculture, I continue to refine Atharv, ensuring it adapts to the evolving challenges faced by farmers. My mission is to empower the agricultural community with advanced technology, enhancing their productivity and promoting sustainable practices. My journey with Atharv is more than just technological advancement; it's about making a meaningful difference in the lives of farmers and contributing positively to the economy.</p>

These enhancements will ensure that Atharv remains a versatile and user-friendly tool for farmers from diverse linguistic backgrounds, helping them to receive the most accurate and helpful information possible.</p>

<h2>License</h2>
<p>Atharv is open source and available under the Apache-2.0 license. This licensing ensures that Atharv can be freely used, modified, and distributed by anyone interested in advancing the technology or customizing it to meet specific needs.</p>
